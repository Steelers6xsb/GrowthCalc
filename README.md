Overview of the Program
Our program, the "Renewal Rate Calculator," is designed to help us forecast and strategize for our company's growth over the next year. It allows us to input data about our clients' current usage and spending, and based on that, it calculates expected growth rates, growth amounts, and new totals for each client. This tool is particularly useful for understanding which clients are expected to grow their business with us and by how much.

How It Works
Data Upload: The first step involves uploading an Excel file containing data for each company we do business with. This data includes the company name, how much they're currently spending, and their usage of our services.

Initial Calculations: Once the data is uploaded, the program calculates a growth rate for each company. This rate is not arbitrary; it's based on how much they use our services compared to how much they spend. We believe that companies that use our services more intensively are more likely to increase their spending.

Adjusting for Cancellations: We understand that not all companies will renew their contracts. The program allows us to select companies that we expect to cancel. After marking these companies, it recalculates the expected growth from the remaining companies to ensure our total growth targets are still met, even accounting for these cancellations.

Proportional Growth Adjustments: If the anticipated growth from remaining clients doesn't offset the loss from cancellations, the program adjusts growth rates upwards, but in a balanced way. It distributes the required increase across companies proportionally, based on their spending, ensuring that our overall growth not only covers the loss but exceeds it by a small margin (2%).

Visualization and Export: At any point, we can visualize our data through a pie chart showing the share of spending by company. Finally, once we are satisfied with the adjustments, the program allows us to export the recalculated data back to an Excel file for further analysis or presentation.

The Mathematics Involved
The mathematical model behind this program focuses on proportional adjustments based on usage metrics and spending to predict growth. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown:

Growth Rate Calculation: The program calculates each company's growth rate based on their "usage" metric relative to the average usage of all companies. The more a company uses our services, the higher their projected growth rate, within a predetermined range (3% to 8%).

Adjusting for Losses: After accounting for cancellations, if the total projected growth isn't sufficient to cover the lost business, the program recalculates the growth rates. It ensures that the remaining companies' increased rates collectively exceed the loss by an additional 2%, distributing the necessary increase proportionally based on each company's spending.

In Summary
This program is a strategic tool that allows us to anticipate and plan for our company's growth by understanding and adjusting for client behavior. It's built on a foundation of proportional mathematics, ensuring that our growth predictions are as realistic and actionable as possible.
